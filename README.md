<b><h2>*** This is an OpenAI (ChatGPT) plug-in for Embarcadero RAD Studio IDE.</h2>
<h3>*** First, you need an API key that you can generate here: https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys
<br>*** It is compatible with Xe5 and later versions, just consider that if you run it in the IDE without opening any project it will raise a message that it cannot load the SSL library, this can be fixed if you put SSL libraries besides the bds.exe or in Bpl folder but you don't have to do that because it will work fine when you open any project in the IDE before using this plugin, I'm not sure that this behavior depends on installed components or libraries or the IDE will load SSL libraries at the moment you open even a new application, although using the plugin when you are working on a project seems more useful anyway.</h3>
<br>Goud luck.
