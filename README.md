# ChatGPTWizard           

<b><h2>This is an OpenAI (ChatGPT) plug-in for Embarcadero RAD Studio IDE.</h2>
<h2>First, you need an API key that you can generate here: (https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)<h2>
<br><h2>Remarks</h2>

1. It is compatible with Xe5 and later versions.
1. Uses XSuperObject library which is included in the project files(https://github.com/onryldz/x-superobject/blob/master/XSuperObject.pas)
1. Settings are stored in registry which can be found here: Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ChatGPTWizard
1. Consider that if you run it in the IDE without opening any project it will raise a message that it cannot load the SSL library
1. This issue can be fixed if you put SSL libraries(can find them in the resource folder) besides the bds.exe or in Bpl folder(mine is this ==> C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\22.0\Bpl)
or you can use a build event on the project's properties to copy these two class libraries if there are not.
Another point: You don't have to do that because it will work fine when you open any project in the IDE before using this plugin! I'm not sure that this behavior depends on the installed components or libraries or if the IDE will load SSL libraries at the moment you open even a new application, although using the plugin when you are working on a project seems more useful anyway.</h3>

<h3><b>How to install</b></h3>
 Open the project, right-click on the project in the project manager, build, and install.

<h3><b>Class View</b></h3>
Using the class view you have your class list with some functionalitis in a popup menu.
It is also possible to use your custom command based on the selected class in the TreeView, in this case @Class will represent the selected class
in your custom command, if you don's use @Class the selected class' source will be attached to the end of your command, just pay attention there will be 
some limitations, because at the moment it's not possible to send thousand of lines through the API request.<b>

<h3><b>History</b></h3>
History is available if you enable it in the setting form, it's using SQLite as a simple file base database.
You can find an empty database in Resource\DB that named "History.sdb", copy this file to any place in the disk and address to the folder in the setting.
