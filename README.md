This is an OpenAI (ChatGPT) plug-in for Embarcadero RAD Studio IDE.
First of all, you need an API key that you can generatehere: https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys
It is compitable with Xe5 and later versions, just consider that if you run it in the IDE wihtout opening any project it will raise a message that it cannot load SSL library, this can be fixed if you put SSL libraries beside the bds.exe but you don't need to do that because it will work fine when you open any project in the IDE before useing this plugin, so use it when you are working on any project.
